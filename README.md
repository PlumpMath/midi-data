# midi-data

Handles parsing of MIDI data tuples to maps containing friendly representations
of the events they represent.

## Rationale

To my knwoledge all of Clojure's exisiting MIDI related namespaces complect the
representation of MIDI messages with the mechanism for sending them.

This library concerns its self only wih the representation of MIDI data and
conversion to and from tuples of 3 values utilised by the vast majority of
backends.

## Documentation

Documentation for this project can be found here: http://triss.github.io/midi-data/ 

It's been written in a literate style and can be generated using
[Marginalia](https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia) and can be recompiled
with:
```
lein marg ./src/midi_data/core.cljc ./test/midi_data/core_test.clj
```
## Testing

The project uses [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje/) for testing.

### How to run the tests

`lein midje` will run all tests.

`lein midje namespace.*` will run only tests beginning with "namespace.".

`lein midje :autotest` will run all the tests indefinitely. It sets up a
watcher on the code files. If they change, only the relevant tests will be
run again.
